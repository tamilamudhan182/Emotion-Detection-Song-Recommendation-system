Emotion-Based Music AI is a smart recommendation engine that detects user emotions and curates personalized music to match or elevate their mood. By blending affective computing with multimedia APIs, it creates a seamless emotional feedback loop between the user and their music environment.
üß† What It Does
- Emotion Detection: Uses facial expressions (via webcam) or biometric signals (e.g., heart rate from MAX30102) to classify emotions like happy, sad, neutral, angry, etc.
- Music Mapping: Matches detected emotions to curated playlists using Spotify API or local music libraries.
- Feedback Loop: Learns from user ratings to improve future recommendations.
- Modular Integration: Easily extendable to support new sensors, emotion classes, or music platforms.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn)
- Flask backend API
- SQLite or Firebase for user data
- Spotify API / Local MP3 player
- Optional: ESP32 + MAX30102 for heart rate-based emotion inference
Use Cases
- Mood-aware music therapy
- Emotion-responsive smart assistants
- Personalized wellness apps
- Interactive installations
